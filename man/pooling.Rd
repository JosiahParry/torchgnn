\usage{
pool_global_add(x, batch = NULL, size = NULL)

pool_global_mean(x, batch = NULL, size = NULL)

pool_global_max(x, batch = NULL, size = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Tensor. Node feature matrix with shape \verb{(total_nodes, features)}.
Contains features for all nodes from all graphs stacked together.}

\item{batch}{Tensor or NULL. Batch vector assigning each node to a graph.
Values should be graph indices starting from 1 (e.g., \code{c(1,1,2,2,2)} for
2 graphs with 2 and 3 nodes). If NULL, treats all nodes as a single graph.}

\item{size}{Integer or NULL. Number of graphs. Automatically calculated if NULL.}
}
\value{
Tensor with shape \verb{(num_graphs, features)} containing graph-level embeddings.
}
\description{
Aggregate node features to graph-level representations for graph classification.
These functions reduce node embeddings within each graph to a single vector.
}
\details{
These functions implement different reduction strategies:
\itemize{
\item \code{pool_global_add}: Sum of node features per graph
\item \code{pool_global_mean}: Mean of node features per graph
\item \code{pool_global_max}: Element-wise maximum of node features per graph
}
}
