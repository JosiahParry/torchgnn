\arguments{
\item{adj}{Sparse torch tensor \verb{n_nodes x n_nodes}. Adjacency matrix defining
graph structure. Must be a sparse COO tensor.}

}
\description{
Aggregators combine neighbor node features in graph neural networks.
Each aggregator implements a different reduction operation (sum, mean, max, etc.)
to aggregate features from neighboring nodes.
}
\details{
Available aggregators:
\itemize{
\item \code{SumAggregator()}: Sum of neighbor features
