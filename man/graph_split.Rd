\title{Create Train/Validation/Test Split for Graph Data}
\usage{
graph_split(data, prop = c(0.6, 0.2, 0.2), seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or adjacency matrix. The full dataset to split.}

\item{prop}{Numeric vector of length 2 or 3. Proportions for splits.
\itemize{
\item Length 2: c(train, test) - creates train/test split
\item Length 3: c(train, val, test) - creates train/val/test split
Must sum to 1.0. Default: c(0.6, 0.2, 0.2)
}}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL. Random seed for reproducibility. Default: NULL}
}
\value{
A graph_split object (list) containing:
\itemize{
\item data: Original data
\item train_id: Integer vector of training indices
\item val_id: Integer vector of validation indices (or NULL if length(prop) == 2)
\item test_id: Integer vector of test indices
}
}
\description{
Creates splits for graph neural networks following rsample's structure.
Unlike traditional ML, GCNs use the full graph during training but only compute
loss on labeled (training) nodes.
}
\details{
The proportions must sum to 1.0. The function creates non-overlapping splits where
each row belongs to exactly one split.

For GCN training, you use:
\itemize{
\item Full X and A_sparse for all forward passes
\item IDs to select which predictions to use for loss computation
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Standard 60/20/20 split
split <- graph_split(A_sparse, seed = 42)

# Custom split (70/15/15)
split <- graph_split(A_sparse, prop = c(0.7, 0.15, 0.15))

# Two-way split (80/20 train/test)
split <- graph_split(A_sparse, prop = c(0.8, 0.2))

# Use in training
predictions <- model(X, A_sparse)
train_loss <- nnf_mse_loss(predictions[split$train_id], y[split$train_id])
}
}
